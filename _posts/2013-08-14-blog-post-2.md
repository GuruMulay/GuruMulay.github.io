In 2013, my teammates in the robotics team and I were desperately searching for a long-distance laser sensor that would
have replaced our short-distance SONAR and IR sensors that had a sensing range of at most 2 meters. We were looking for
a sensor that would at least give us a sensing range of 5 meters and that would be cheaper to buy given our limited
budget that we, as a team, would have preferred spending on something more worthwhile than a single piece of laser sensors.
In general, the SONAR and IR sensors that we bought were always inexpensive as compared to the laser sensors.

[TODO]

So, I got this sensor worth ~5% of our annual robotics team budget for free from this company.
