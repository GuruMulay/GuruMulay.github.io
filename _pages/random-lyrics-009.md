Up high I feel like I'm alive for the very first time  <br/>
Set up high I'm strong enough to take these dreams and make them mine <br/>
Set up high I'm strong enough to take these dreams and make them mine <br/>

<br/>

Can you take me higher? <br/>
To the place where blind men see <br/>
Can you take me higher? <br/>
To the place with golden streets <br/>
