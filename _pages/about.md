Hi! I am Guru - a graduate student in Computer Science at Colorado State University. I work in [Computer Vision Lab](https://www.cs.colostate.edu/~vision/) under [Dr. Bruce Draper](https://www.cs.colostate.edu/~draper/index.php) and [Dr. Ross Beveridge](https://www.cs.colostate.edu/~ross/index.php).
I am involved in one of the coolest projects [Communicating with Computers](https://www.cs.colostate.edu/~draper/CwC.php) in computer vision.
My [current research work for M.S. thesis](https://gurumulay.github.io/vision/vision-0/) focuses on exploring and developing Convolutional Neural Networks, specifically the Pose Machines, for [Human Pose Estimation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Articulated_body_pose_estimation) from only RGB images.

Previously, I was an undergraduate research student in the [Robotics Lab](http://robocon.in/) of MIT Pune, India under
the guidance of my adviser late Dr. Savita Kulkarni. I worked with a team of awesome students to build some awesome
Robots like [these](http://robocon.in/photos/2013-2/) and [these from our Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/MITRobocon)!

I love to hike and bike on scenic trails and mountains. I also love learning interesting things about space exploration and archaeology.
