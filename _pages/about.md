Hi! I am Guru - a graduate student in Computer Science at Colorado State University. I work in [Computer Vision Lab](https://www.cs.colostate.edu/~vision/) under [Dr. Bruce Draper](https://www.cs.colostate.edu/~draper/index.php) and [Dr. Ross Beveridge](https://www.cs.colostate.edu/~ross/index.php).
I am involved in one of the coolest projects [Communicating with Computers](https://www.cs.colostate.edu/~draper/home_research.php) in computer vision.
My current research work for MS thesis focuses on exploring and developing Convolutional Neural Networks, specifically the Pose Machines, to predict person's joint locations given only an RGB image of the person.

Previously, I was an undergraduate research student in the [Robotics Lab](http://robocon.in/) of MIT Pune, India, where I worked with a team of some awesome students to build some awesome Robots like [these](http://robocon.in/photos/2013-2/) and [these from our Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/MITRobocon)!

I love to go on hikes, bike on scenic trails, and to learn interesting things about space exploration and archaeology.

Check out some of my projects assembled in categories in the Navigation Bar at the top. If you don't like reading and enjoy browsing images then jump directly to [this gallery page](https://gurumulay.github.io/gallery/).
