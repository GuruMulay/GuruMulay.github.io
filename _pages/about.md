Hi! I am Guru - a Graduate Student in Computer Science at Colorado State University. I work in the [Computer Vision Lab](https://www.cs.colostate.edu/~vision/) under [Dr. Bruce Draper](https://www.cs.colostate.edu/~draper/index.php) and [Dr. Ross Beveridge](https://www.cs.colostate.edu/~ross/index.php).
I am involved in one of the coolest projects [Communicating with Computers](https://www.cs.colostate.edu/~draper/home_research.php) in computer vision.
My current research work for my thesis focuses on exploring and developing Convolutional Neural Networks, specifically the Pose Machines, to predict the person's joint locations given only an RGB image of the person.

Previously, I was an undergraduate research student in the [Robotics Lab](http://robocon.in/) of MIT Pune, India, where I worked with a team of some awesome students to build some awesome Robots like [these](http://robocon.in/photos/2013-2/) and [these from our Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/MITRobocon)!

I love to go on hikes, bike on scenic trails, and to learn interesting things about the space exploration and archeology.
