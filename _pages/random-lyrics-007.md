    " <br/>

You say you're not gonna fight <br/>
'Cause no one will fight for you <br/>
And you think there's not enough love <br/>
And no one to give it to <br/>
And you're sure you've hurt for so long <br/>
You've got nothing left to lose <br/>
So, you say you're not gonna fight <br/>
'Cause no one will fight for you <br/>

<br/>

You say the weight of the world <br/>
Has kept you from letting go <br/>
And you think compassion's a flaw <br/>
And you'll never let it show <br/>
And you're sure you've hurt in a way <br/>
That no one will ever know <br/>
But someday, the weight of the world <br/>
Will give you the strength to go <br/>
