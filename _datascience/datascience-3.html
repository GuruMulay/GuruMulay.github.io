<p>
    An N-gram is a contiguous sequence of N items from a given sequence of text or speech [1]. Probabilistic modeling of
    N-grams is useful for predicting the next item in a sequence in Markov models.
    For sequences of words, n-grams comprising of 1 word are called as unigram (1-gram). For set of 2 words, it's called as
    bigram (2-gram), for set of 3 words it's called as trigram (3-gram) and so on.

    For example, consider following sentence:
</p>

<!--<p style="font-family:Lucida Console;">This is a paragraph.</p>-->

<code>
    Let's study Big Data

</code>

<br style="margin-bottom:25px;"/>


<p>
    The 1-grams for this sentence are <code>["Let's", "study", "Big", "Data"]</code>. The 2-grams are
    <code>["__, Let's", "Let's, study", "study, Big", "Big, Data", "Data, __"]</code>.
    Here, "__" represents the empty space before and after the sentence which helps to distinguish whether the word was
    used in the beginning or the end of the sentence or whether word was paired with other words.
</p>


<p>
    N-gram analysis finds applications in many areas such as sequence prediction, sequence completion (such as the one
    in Gmail's August 2018 updated version), plagiarism detection, searching for similar documents, sentiment analysis
    automatic authorship detection, and linguistic cultural trend analysis.

    Not to mention that Google has already spent several thousands of hours doing research in this field given that it
    helps them in many products such as Google search engine, Gmail, Google Docs, Google Assistant, Google Voice
    transcription, and many more. They have created a great tool called <a href="https://books.google.com/ngrams/">
    Google Ngram Viewer</a> which allows you to analyse words from English (as well as several more languages) for their
    frequency of use over time, occurrences in specific corpus, etc. You could get more information about this tool
    <a href="https://books.google.com/ngrams/info"> here on info their page.</a>

    <b>Introduction:</b>
    </big>
</p>

<p>
    For this project, the goal was to create an N-gram profile of a corpus of modern English literature formed by
    subsetting around 1GB of dataset that included more than 2500 books from Gutenberg project [2]. Major steps
    involved: (1) Extracting all the unigrams and bigrams, (2) Computing the frequency of each unigram and bigram, and (3) Ranking
    the unigrams and bigrams based on those frequencies.

    <b>Dataset:</b>
    </big>
</p>

<p>
    Dataset - which was provided to us during the class - was compiled from the set of EBook files available as a part
    of Project Gutenberg. It was a small subset of size ~1gb consisting of lines from several books from the
    Project Gutenberg. Each line looked as follows:

    <br style="margin-bottom:15px;"/>
    <code>AUTHOR<===>DATE<===>A SINGLE LINE FROM THE DATASET FILE</code>
    <br style="margin-bottom:15px;"/>


    A specific example would be:

    <br style="margin-bottom:15px;"/>
    <code>Arthur Conan Doyle<===>June 19, 2008<===>"Well, by his insufferable rudeness and impossible behavior."</code>
    <br style="margin-bottom:15px;"/>

    For this project we were instructed to work with author's last name from <code>AUTHOR</code> field (last author in
    case of multiple authors) and only the year part of <code>DATE</code> field.

    <!--<b>BigQuery:</b>-->
    <!--<br/>-->
    <!--<br/>-->
    <!--Web API of BigQuery is very simple to use. As seen in the Figure 2, the API has a-->
<!--query window at the top to query any dataset that are available within your project or-->
<!--that are public (e.g., SOTorrent dataset released by the authors).-->
<!--Right below the query area, you will see results of the query when query is-->
<!--completed. It also shows the schema of the database or the table that you select from the-->
<!--left panel. The left panel shows all the datasets, their tables, and your query history. The best thing, in my opinion,-->
<!--about BigQuery is that it will alert you when your query is completed. This becomes really handy when your queries take-->
<!--hours to run.-->

<!--<strong>Answering RQ1:</strong>-->

<!--We wanted to explore which languages are most frequently edited in the code snippets-->
<!--on SO. For this we used our CodeBlocksWithTags table and counted the languages with-->
<!--the most number of code blocks. Figure 3 shows the distribution of four most popular-->
<!--technologies – Android, C#, Python and Java. We see that Java is not only the most-->
<!--popular programming language on SO, but it is also the most frequently edited language-->
<!--in the code blocks in the posts. It tops the charts with over 3.6 million code blocks.-->
<!--Python follows next, and then Android and C#. However, all these three are almost at the-->
<!--same level. Interestingly, the combined contribution of all these three is almost as same-->
<!--as that of Java alone.-->

<!--Going a step further in discussion, we know that Android development is mostly in Java,-->
<!--so we can safely conclude that Java is pretty much the most used technology at present.-->

<!--&lt;!&ndash;&ndash;&gt;-->
<!--<strong>Answering RQ2:</strong>-->

<!--We see that the users from the city of Bangalore have contributed towards most of the-->
<!--edits. It is followed by New York and London, and then Bay Area in California. Seattle-->
<!--users have contributed the least towards the edits among all these five locations.-->


<!--<div style="text-align: center">-->
    <!--<a href="/images/csu/proj/sotorrent/rq2_1.png">-->

    <!--<br/>-->
    <!--<br/>-->
    <!--<figcaption>Fig. 4: Edits from most popular geographical locations</figcaption>-->
<!--</div>-->
<!--<br/>-->


<!--Moving further in the analysis, we tried to explore which languages are most popular-->
<!--among the users in these cities. So we filtered the code snippets on language and location-->
<!--and plotted them together. Figure 5 shows our results. Not surprisingly, Java is the most-->
<!--frequently edited language in the code snippets, in all the cities. However, there is a slight-->
<!--variation of the remaining languages in the five cities and we see some interesting results-->
<!--here. For instance, Android is the second most popular technology among Bangalore-->
<!--users, with two to three times as much edits to Android-related tags as the other four-->
<!--areas. So, we can say that there is a lot of Android development going on in Bangalore.-->
<!--London has the highest proportion of C# edit, suggesting a high percentage of developers-->
<!--are using the Microsoft stack. However, Bay-Area, very few users seem to use C#, as it-->
<!--is the least frequently edited language in this area. New York leads in Python among all-->
<!--cities. The ratio of Python and Java is larger than Android and C#. This could probably-->
<!--be due to a combination of finance, academic research, and data science at tech-->
<!--companies.-->

<!--We filtered out post blocks with tags for the common operating systems – Linux, Mac-->
<!--OS, and Microsoft Windows, and plotted them for each of the five geographical regions-->
<!--to see which OS is the most popular. As shown in Figure 6, we found that for London,-->
<!--New York and Seattle, there is not much difference in the number of post blocks for the-->
<!--three OSs. However, Bangalore users post a lot of posts for Linux and very few for Mac-->
<!--OS. And in Bay Area, Windows is surprisingly the least popular OS out of the three.-->
<!--Finally, in Bay Area and London, Mac OS is the most popular OS.-->
<!--For the final part of this RQ, we created a table Users_TopEdits_ByLocation_1000Edits-->
<!--that contains all the users and their locations only if the user has contributed more than-->
<!--1000 times to the post block edits. We see from Figure 7 that the USA has 824 users who-->
<!--contributed to post block edits in past 3 years of SO Torrent data. After the USA, we-->
<!--have India where most of the software development jobs are outsourced. This might be-->
<!--the reason why developers are contributing more given their background in software-->
<!--development. We observed that there is some inconsistency in the way users report their-->
<!--locations on Stackoverflow website. There is a large number of users who did not report-->
<!--their location, or they just wrote the name of city without country name, or they wrote-->
<!--some weird locations such as the Earth, Universe, etc. This inconsistency affected our-->
<!--results.-->

<!--<strong>Answering RQ3:</strong>-->

<!--We analysed the PostVersionUrl table to extract the domain names in a standard format-->
<!--(for example www.domainname.com) and then sorted the domain names in the order of-->
<!--frequency of their use. The results in the Figure 8 show that the I.stack.imgur.com and-->
<!--stackoverflow.com are being referenced more that 1 million times in the posts blocks-->
<!--and code blocks. This seems consistent with the general observation on SO website-->
<!--where we see that users tend to post images of codes that are hosted by the popular image-->
<!--hosting website imgur.com and users tend to refer to other posts from the stackoverflow-->
<!--website in the answers. We also see links to links to popular websites in developers such-->
<!--as github.com, python.org, oracle.com, and also the wikipedia.com.-->
<!--Analysis of PostReferenceGH show that GitHub repositories such as cdnjs, tensorflow,-->
<!--etc have more links to SO posts. This analysis was trickier because the SOTorrent dataset-->
<!--does not take into consideration the fact that GitHub users usually fork the original-->
<!--repositories frequently. Therefore, the links to SO is added in the table for every single-->
<!--fork of the original repository. For example, we observed that cdnjs/cdnjs project was-->
<!--forked by over 100 GitHub users. So, the 1837 links in the original repo were added in-->
<!--the table for every single fork.-->

<!--<div style="text-align: center">-->
    <!--<a href="/images/csu/proj/sotorrent/rq3_1.png">-->
        <!--<img src="/images/csu/proj/sotorrent/rq3_1.png" alt="External URLs found in SO posts" align="middle" width="800">-->

    <!--<br/>-->
    <!--<br/>-->
    <!--<figcaption>Fig. 8: External URLs found in SO posts</figcaption>-->
<!--</div>-->
<!--<br/>-->


<!--Therefore, we had to manually analyse the table which sorts the repos by the frequency-->
<!--of the SO links. The results in the Figure 9 show that the repo cdnjs has the most links-->
<!--to the SO website. We can also observe that the repos like TensorFlow that were-->
<!--introduced in the period has many links to SO posts owing to the fact that it is still under-->
<!--the development.-->

    <!--<br/>-->
    <!--<br/>-->
    <!--<figcaption>Fig. 9: Links to SO from GitHub projects</figcaption>-->
<!--</div>-->
<!--<br/>-->


<!--Finally, we also analysed what are the languages used in the repos that frequently refer-->
<!--to the SO posts. For the 3 years of data, we observed that .js, .swift, .py files have more-->
<!--references to SO posts, which suggests that languages like javascript, swift, python were-->
<!--popular, and developers wrote many snippets in these languages. We have presented the-->
<!--results in Figure 10 and 11. For the entire 10 years of data, we observed that developers-->
<!--had many snippets in javascript. However, languages like swift and go were not popular-->
<!--when all the data is considered together.-->

<!--&lt;!&ndash;&ndash;&gt;-->
<!--<strong>Answering RQ4:</strong>-->

<!--We used PostBlockVersion table to count the number code and text blocks with 1 edits,-->
<!--2 edits, and so on. We observed that 60.32% of the code blocks were only edited once-->
<!--while 61.94% text blocks were edited only once.-->
<!--From Figure 12, we see that most of the blocks are edited at most 4 times. We observed-->
<!--that some of the blocks were edited over 50 times in their lifetime. This analysis suggests-->
<!--that a text or code block would most probably be edited between 1 to 4 times.-->

    <!--<b>Conclusions:</b>-->
<!--</p>-->


<!--<ul>-->
    <!--<li>Analysis of SOTorrent answered all our research questions involving evolution of-->
        <!--post blocks revealing expected patterns like such as imgur being the most referenced website and unexpected-->
        <!--patterns such as developers in Seattle (Headquarters of Windows) have tagged Windows fewer times than other OS-->
        <!--like Linux or MacOS.-->

    <!--<li><a href="https://github.com/cdnjs/cdnjs"><strong>cdnjs</strong></a> repo is forked 3651 times on GitHub which-->
      <!--causes many issues during the creation of SOTorrent dataset. The repo has several thousands of .js files and within-->
      <!--them there are several links to SO posts. The tables likePostReferenceGH have 'kind of' replicated data because-->
      <!--of the large number of forks.</li>-->

    <!--<li>Repositories forked multiple times should be detected and correctly accommodated in PostReferenceGH table in-->
      <!--order to have normalized and balanced database.</li>-->
