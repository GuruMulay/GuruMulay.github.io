    <b>Yelp Dataset Description:</b>
    </big>
</p>

<p>
    <a href="https://www.yelp.com/dataset_challenge">Yelp Business dataset </a> is freely available for academic
    research. It covers the businesses from select major cities such as Pittsburgh, Charlotte, Urbana-Champaign, Phoenix
    , Las Vegas, Madison, and Cleveland from the USA and few more cities from other countries. The original data is
    subdivided into five different sub-datasets viz., business, review, user, check-in, and tip. Each of these
    sub-datasets is a JSON file with one JSON-object per line, which contain nested JSON arrays and objects.
</p>


<ul>
    <li><b>Sub-datasets: Business, User Review, Check-in</b>; Total size: 5 GB</li>
    <li><b>Business:</b> 144K businesses with stars, attributes, categories such as parking availability, happy hour,
        drive through, restaurants table service</li>
    <li><b>Review:</b> 4M user comments, useful votes</li>
    <li><b>Check-in:</b> check-in counts</li>
</ul>

    <b>Challenges with Yelp dataset:</b>
    </big>
</p>


<ul>
    <li><b>Huge feature space with categorical features:</b></li> Yelp dataset has numerous categories in the features
    like business attributes, categories, zip-codes, etc. These features are qualitative features that does not have a
    numerical value associated with them.

    <br/>
    <br/>

    <li><b>Integration of sub-datasets:</b></li> Another challenge was the integration of four different sub-datasets
    using a number of map-reduce jobs. For example, in one of the methodology we require the dataset in the form
    of business_id, attributes_count, categories_count, check-in_counts, review_counts, stars. This requires a series of
    map reduce jobs to get rea data with required fields.

    <!--<li>For a specific city, collected all Business_id, Latitude, Longitude, and Stars</li>-->
</ul>

    <b>Feature Selection & Ratings Prediction:</b>
    </big>
</p>

<p>
    Yelp business dataset has a large number of features in the attributes and categories columns.
    These features are mostly categorical wherein businesses have some unique and some common
    features. In order to form a feature space for our analysis, we select the top N frequently
    occurring attributes in businesses and top N frequently occurring categories in business. We use this feature space
    for the ratings prediction. Figure 1 shows the architecture of the map-reduce jobs for feature selection.
    The first map-reduce job parses the JSON object for the business data to produce <code>&lt;bID, stars
    features&gt;</code>. The second map-reduce job reads this file to order the features by their frequency.
    Figure2 below show frequently occurring attributes and categories in Yelp dataset.

    Given a set of features per business, we train machine learning models on the training data and use this model to
    predict the star ratings of any business from the testing data. We tried regression models to predict rating based
    on the count of features from feature space. However, this approach did not work properly. Therefore we moved to
    classification approach. We used multiple models from scikit-learn on the categorical feature space viz.,
    Support Vector Machine (SVM) with linear kernel, SVM RBF kernel, Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), SGD with kernel.
    We formulated the classification problem as a multi-class classification problem with 11 output
    classes corresponding to the 11 values of ratings viz., [0, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5]. The
    results were better as compared to linear regression but not really the best. The classifiers work well only for a
    few of the classes, for example class 8 class 10 from figure 3. This suggest that we need to extract better features
    from the datasets or tune the parameters of classifiers better.

    <br>
    <br>
    <b>Evaluation of classification models:</b>
    <br>
    <br>

    The dataset we use on categorical feature space (i.e., attributes) has 144072 samples (i.e,
    business_id). We divide the dataset into 80-20 train-test split. Ground truth is the available
    ratings in terms of stars (out of 5). For the purpose of classification we convert the class values from
    floating values to integer values by multiplying by 2. Therefore classes [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
    represent the actual rating of [0, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5].
    Figure 3 shows the Precision, Recall, and f1 scores for the classification methods.
    This is clearly not the best outcome of training a classifier, but given the time constraints for this class project
    we had dto settle to these results without doing any further analysis.


    <!--The confusion matrices for SVM_linear, SVM_RBF, SGD, and SGD_kernel are shown in the figure 3. Elements along diagonal are-->
    <!--the correctly classified businesses and the non-diagonal elements are either false positives or false negatives.-->


    <!--The feature spaces that we use for this analysis are: a) categorical features as described earlier and  b) counts based feature space.-->
    <!--General architecture of ‘ratings prediction’ methodology is shown in figure 3. We use map-reduce jobs to create-->
    <!--features such as review counts, check-in counts, attribute counts, category counts and stars for each business-->
    <!--that were arranged based on business_id as the key. Using these features, we trained machine learning models in-->
    <!--Python using scikit-learn.-->

    <b>Sentiment analysis:</b>
    </big>
</p>

<p>
    We use the set of reviews associated with every business_id retrieved from the 'user reviews dataset'
    using Map Reduce.The architecture of the map-reduce jobs is given in figure below. At the end of the first
    map-reduce job, we get the data in the format <code>&lt;reviewID, stars [review text]&gt</code>;.
    We find the overall sentiment for a given business following the sentiment analysis method described in the article
    [1]. Finally, we integrated the individual user reviews with their sentiment value with
    the ‘business dataset’ using ‘business_id’ as the primary key. Then we find the mean value of the
    sentiment for each business based on the sentiments of all the review for that business.
    We use two text files pos-words.txt and neg-words.txt [1] to get a set of positive and
    negative words. Then we find the total number of positive and negative words that are mentioned
    in a review. Now, using following formula described in [1] we calculate the total sentiment value
    associated with the review.

    <br/>
    \begin{equation}
    sentimentValue = (nPositive − nNegative)/(nPositive + nNegative)
    \label{eq:t1}
    \end{equation}
    <br/>

    This method tell whether the reviews are of positive, negative, or neutral sentiment. This analysis helps
    the business owner determine the overall sentiment about their business and whether they need to improve their
    service or features knowing their average review sentiment value between -1 to +1.
