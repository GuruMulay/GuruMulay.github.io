<p>
    Stack Overflow is one of the most visited question-and-answer forums for software developers. This is evident
    from the fact that as of April 2018, it has over 39.6 million posts and over 8.5 million registered users [1].
    Apart from questions and answers text, it also contains code snippets. The text and code snippets evolve over time
    when the users edit them. However, there is no provision in the official Stack Overflow (SO) data dump to study this
    evolution. <a href="http://empirical-software.engineering/blog/sotorrent">SOTorrent</a>, derived from the official
    SO data dump, is one such open-source dataset that provides the version history
    of SO texts and code snippets/blocks. SOTorrent was released by Baltes et. al. [2] specifically to address
    the need for studying evolution of SO posts at a fine-grain level of snippets. It is hosted on
    <a href="https://bigquery.cloud.google.com/dataset/sotorrent-org:2018_02_16" >Google Cloud Platform</a>
    with an excellent, informative introduction by the authors on the
    <a href="http://empirical-software.engineering/blog/sotorrent">dataset's website</a>.
    It is a superset of the SO dump and you can find its short schema
    <a href="http://empirical-software.engineering/assets/images/sotorrent_model_msr.png">here</a>.
    As a short introduction, here are some statistics about the SOTorrent dataset:

    We mine the SOTorrent dataset to explore the evolution of code snippets on Stack Overflow. As a part of CS581
    (Software Maintenance & Evolution), we (I and Abhimanyu Chawala) formulated some research questions and answered
    by analysing SOTorrent. We used Google Cloud Platform's BigQuery for the analysis. <strong> Note </strong>that SOTorrent
    has 17 tables sizing up to 289.4 GB. Under the scope of the project with given time constraints, we decided to work with a subset
    of the entire SOTorrent dataset. For this subset, we cropped <em> Posts table </em> by date and selected the
    records from 1st January 2016 to 11th March 2018 and cropped all the other tables accordingly. This significantly
    reduced the dataset size and query completion times. Consequently, it gave us results comparatively quickly.

    <b>BigQuery:</b>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Web API of BigQuery is very simple to use. As seen in the Figure 2, the API has a
query window at the top to query any dataset that are available within your project or
that are public (e.g., SOTorrent dataset released by the authors).
Right below the query area, you will see results of the query when query is
completed. It also shows the schema of the database or the table that you select from the
left panel. The left panel shows all the datasets, their tables, and your query history. The best thing, in my opinion,
about BigQuery is that it will alert you when your query is completed. This becomes really handy when your queries take
hours to run.

A standard query might look something like this:

#standardSQL <br/>
SELECT PS.* <br/>
FROM `sotorrent-org.2018_03_28.Posts` AS PS <br/>
WHERE PS.CreationDate >= '2015-01-01' <br/>

<strong>Answering RQ1:</strong>

We wanted to explore which languages are most frequently edited in the code snippets
on SO. For this we used our CodeBlocksWithTags table and counted the languages with
the most number of code blocks. Figure 3 shows the distribution of four most popular
technologies – Android, C#, Python and Java. We see that Java is not only the most
popular programming language on SO, but it is also the most frequently edited language
in the code blocks in the posts. It tops the charts with over 3.6 million code blocks.
Python follows next, and then Android and C#. However, all these three are almost at the
same level. Interestingly, the combined contribution of all these three is almost as same
as that of Java alone.

Going a step further in discussion, we know that Android development is mostly in Java,
so we can safely conclude that Java is pretty much the most used technology at present.

<strong>Answering RQ2:</strong>

We see that the users from the city of Bangalore have contributed towards most of the
edits. It is followed by New York and London, and then Bay Area in California. Seattle
users have contributed the least towards the edits among all these five locations.


<div style="text-align: center">
    <a href="/images/csu/proj/sotorrent/rq2_1.png">
        <img src="/images/csu/proj/sotorrent/rq2_1.png" alt="Edits from most popular geographical locations" align="middle" width="700">
    </a>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <figcaption>Fig. 4: Edits from most popular geographical locations</figcaption>
</div>
<br/>


Moving further in the analysis, we tried to explore which languages are most popular
among the users in these cities. So we filtered the code snippets on language and location
and plotted them together. Figure 5 shows our results. Not surprisingly, Java is the most
frequently edited language in the code snippets, in all the cities. However, there is a slight
variation of the remaining languages in the five cities and we see some interesting results
here. For instance, Android is the second most popular technology among Bangalore
users, with two to three times as much edits to Android-related tags as the other four
areas. So, we can say that there is a lot of Android development going on in Bangalore.
London has the highest proportion of C# edit, suggesting a high percentage of developers
are using the Microsoft stack. However, Bay-Area, very few users seem to use C#, as it
is the least frequently edited language in this area. New York leads in Python among all
cities. The ratio of Python and Java is larger than Android and C#. This could probably
be due to a combination of finance, academic research, and data science at tech
companies.

    <br/>
    <figcaption>Fig. 6: Popularity of various Operating Systems</figcaption>
</div>
<br/>




We filtered out post blocks with tags for the common operating systems – Linux, Mac
OS, and Microsoft Windows, and plotted them for each of the five geographical regions
to see which OS is the most popular. As shown in Figure 6, we found that for London,
New York and Seattle, there is not much difference in the number of post blocks for the
three OSs. However, Bangalore users post a lot of posts for Linux and very few for Mac
OS. And in Bay Area, Windows is surprisingly the least popular OS out of the three.
Finally, in Bay Area and London, Mac OS is the most popular OS.
For the final part of this RQ, we created a table Users_TopEdits_ByLocation_1000Edits
that contains all the users and their locations only if the user has contributed more than
1000 times to the post block edits. We see from Figure 7 that the USA has 824 users who
contributed to post block edits in past 3 years of SO Torrent data. After the USA, we
have India where most of the software development jobs are outsourced. This might be
the reason why developers are contributing more given their background in software
development. We observed that there is some inconsistency in the way users report their
locations on Stackoverflow website. There is a large number of users who did not report
their location, or they just wrote the name of city without country name, or they wrote
some weird locations such as the Earth, Universe, etc. This inconsistency affected our
results.

<strong>Answering RQ3:</strong>

We analysed the PostVersionUrl table to extract the domain names in a standard format
(for example www.domainname.com) and then sorted the domain names in the order of
frequency of their use. The results in the Figure 8 show that the I.stack.imgur.com and
stackoverflow.com are being referenced more that 1 million times in the posts blocks
and code blocks. This seems consistent with the general observation on SO website
where we see that users tend to post images of codes that are hosted by the popular image
hosting website imgur.com and users tend to refer to other posts from the stackoverflow
website in the answers. We also see links to links to popular websites in developers such
as github.com, python.org, oracle.com, and also the wikipedia.com.
Analysis of PostReferenceGH show that GitHub repositories such as cdnjs, tensorflow,
etc have more links to SO posts. This analysis was trickier because the SOTorrent dataset
does not take into consideration the fact that GitHub users usually fork the original
repositories frequently. Therefore, the links to SO is added in the table for every single
fork of the original repository. For example, we observed that cdnjs/cdnjs project was
forked by over 100 GitHub users. So, the 1837 links in the original repo were added in
the table for every single fork.

<div style="text-align: center">
    <a href="/images/csu/proj/sotorrent/rq3_1.png">
        <img src="/images/csu/proj/sotorrent/rq3_1.png" alt="External URLs found in SO posts" align="middle" width="800">
    </a>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <figcaption>Fig. 8: External URLs found in SO posts</figcaption>
</div>
<br/>


Therefore, we had to manually analyse the table which sorts the repos by the frequency
of the SO links. The results in the Figure 9 show that the repo cdnjs has the most links
to the SO website. We can also observe that the repos like TensorFlow that were
introduced in the period has many links to SO posts owing to the fact that it is still under
the development.

    </a>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <figcaption>Fig. 9: Links to SO from GitHub projects</figcaption>
</div>
<br/>


Finally, we also analysed what are the languages used in the repos that frequently refer
to the SO posts. For the 3 years of data, we observed that .js, .swift, .py files have more
references to SO posts, which suggests that languages like javascript, swift, python were
popular, and developers wrote many snippets in these languages. We have presented the
results in Figure 10 and 11. For the entire 10 years of data, we observed that developers
had many snippets in javascript. However, languages like swift and go were not popular
when all the data is considered together.

<strong>Answering RQ4:</strong>

We used PostBlockVersion table to count the number code and text blocks with 1 edits,
2 edits, and so on. We observed that 60.32% of the code blocks were only edited once
while 61.94% text blocks were edited only once.
From Figure 12, we see that most of the blocks are edited at most 4 times. We observed
that some of the blocks were edited over 50 times in their lifetime. This analysis suggests
that a text or code block would most probably be edited between 1 to 4 times.

    <b>Conclusions:</b>
</p>


<ul>
    <li>Analysis of SOTorrent answered all our research questions involving evolution of
        post blocks revealing expected patterns like such as imgur being the most referenced website and unexpected
        patterns such as developers in Seattle (Headquarters of Windows) have tagged Windows fewer times than other OS
        like Linux or MacOS.

    <li><a href="https://github.com/cdnjs/cdnjs"><strong>cdnjs</strong></a> repo is forked 3651 times on GitHub which
      causes many issues during the creation of SOTorrent dataset. The repo has several thousands of .js files and within
      them there are several links to SO posts. The tables likePostReferenceGH have 'kind of' replicated data because
      of the large number of forks.</li>

    <li>Repositories forked multiple times should be detected and correctly accommodated in PostReferenceGH table in
      order to have normalized and balanced database.</li>
