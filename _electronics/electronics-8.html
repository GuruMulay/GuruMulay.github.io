<p>
    Size of the footprint of a motor driver circuit primarily depends on the footprint area of the MOSFETs and their driver circuitry,
    heat-sinks for the MOSFETs, and the connectors. A DIP packaged MOSFET requires a large heat-sink (Figure 3) because
    the heat dissipated is large as compared to the SMD counterpart of the same MOSFET family. This is because, the
    on-state resistance (RDS-ON) of a DIP MOSFET is typically much larger as compared to an SMD MOSFET. Therefore, in a
    power motor driver circuit, the power dissipated due to this resistance is higher in a DIP MOSFET as compared to the
    SMD MOSFET. As a result if you use a SMD MOSFET in a motor driver circuit, then you can avoid using large physical
    heat-sinks because the SMD MOSFETs will not heat up as much as the DIP MOSFETs at the same power levels of the
    circuit.

    <br/>
    <br/>

    The motivation for this motor driver was to decrease the heat dissipated from the motor driver and thereby
    increasing the reliability and life-span of the motor driver circuit as a whole. This motor driver was the a version
    of <a href="/electronics/electronics-1/">the IR motor driver that I discussed in earlier post.</a>
    Instead of using DIP packaged IRFZ48N series MOSFETs, I used Texas Instruments' CSD18501Q5A series SMD MOSFETs.
    These SMD MOSFETs have really small footprint (smaller than a pinky nail). In Figure 1, you can see the footprint of
    MOSFETs on the right side that has a h-bridge using four SMD MOSFETs. Also, their RDS-ON is extremely small as
    compared to the DIP MOSFETs. Therefore, this circuit did not require any physical heat-sinks (like Figure 3). The
    heat sinking process achieved by providing very thick ground pads that occupied a large area of the PCB footprint.

    <br/>
    <br/>

    This motor driver is for bidirectional speed control of only one motor. It requires four MOSFETs for to form a
    standard H-bridge configuration. The PCB has dimensions of 5.3 cm X 4.0 cm (~ 2.08 inch X 1.57 inch).
    In perspective of a DC-motor driver capable of providing 5-10 Amperes of continuous current, this board was really
    a small, tiny, self-containing, and compact board.

    <br/>
    <br/>

    I tested this motor driver on-load with various types of DC motors such as standard, economic,
    <a href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/High-Torque-Low-Speed-Solder-Cylindricaluction-Gear-Box-Motor-DC-24V-20RPM/127991422">
        low-end DC motors like these</a>, MAXON DC motors, power-window motor, wiper motor, etc. The later two are high
    torque motors which require very high power to drive them while former two are high RPM motors that work on low
    power. In figure 4 you can see the circuit being tested on a wiper motor which drew 3A current at 9V without
    even putting any load on the motor. With on-load testing the typical continuous current for this particular motor
    was about 8A.

    <br/>
    <br/>

    After working with DIP packaged MOSFETs for several years, I found it astonishing to see those tiny, pea-sized MOSFET
    carried continuous currents over 5A for several minutes on-load at operating voltage of 24V. Even more surprising
    was that the MOSFETs did not heat crazily unlike the DIP MOSFETs at the same power levels. I still cannot fathom the
    fact that a tiny thing made from silicon and other fancy stuff can conduct excess of 5A currents continuously
    without burning out!

    Here is the motor driver PCB in action on-load with a
    <a href="https://wiki.ece.cmu.edu/ddl/index.php/Windshield_wiper_assembly_2">wiper motor</a> that requires high power
    to drive because it is a high-torque motor. This specific motor circuit was a dual version of the PCB that we are
    discussing in this post and it could driver 2 motors independently and simultaneously. As you may have figured out
    that it was an obvious quick-and-dirty prototype PCB. But being the first version, it worked pretty well on its
    maiden on-load testing!

    <br/>
    <br/>

    I remember that I was extremely happy to see the prototype working like a charm because soldering those 8 SMD MOSFETs
    took eons. With a little exaggeration, I had to put my blood, sweat, and tears ensuring that the tiny tiny pins of
    the MSOFETs did not get short! I think those pins are like 0.5 mm apart at the best (Figure 1).
    You short Gate to Drain and boooom ..... expect 4 hours of soldering (and life) to go in vain!
